<h3>Personal Paragraph</h3>
<p>Hello once again, Bruce. It is me, Brock. It has been a full year now since intro to programming, and I am pleased to say I still remember a decent portion of what you taught us. I still like gaming, and coding. I have a couple ideas for games, most are rather ambitious for one person with no artistic talent to speak of, but I am hoping that Blender will be technical enough that my lack of drawing ability is negligible. Currently I am unsure if I want to do IT or game programming.  </p>
<h4>Course Outcomes</h4>
<p> I really want to improve my programming thinking and expand my code vocabulary. I have looked on w3schools and there is some extremely simple game code that I have been meaning to try, but I am rather busy with my classes this quarter. I ultimately want to expand the dice rolling adventure game or make a new gambling dice game this quarter.</p>
<h4>Programming Experience</h4>
<p>I am a novice, and would not like to be classified any higher at present time. I am not a beginner, I still remember how to make a d10 dice roller, I set up a loop while you were explaining it in class before you finished. But I forgot a decent portion from last time as well.</p>
